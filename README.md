# home automation(iot)

This project is based on nodeMCU(ESP8266), this is it based wifi module which can communicate with serial USB or through wifi using this I have designed to control 4 led's from the phone, google assistant and the physical buttons

this is my binary file which u can upload to node MCU using Arduino ide,
#note 
pins in Arduino ide is mapped with the Arduino UNO for the corresponding node MCU GPIO pins I have included the pin diagram and picture of my project down below
